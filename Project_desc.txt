Perfect! I've created a comprehensive Flutter app called "duplicate_removal_ai" with the following features:
🚀 Key Features:
AI-Powered Detection:

Hash-based duplicate detection for exact matches
Perceptual hashing for visually similar images
Smart file comparison algorithms

Multiple Scan Types:

Image scanning (photos, pictures)
Document scanning (PDFs, Word docs, etc.)
Full system scan (all file types)

Smart UI/UX:

Modern Material Design interface
Progress tracking during scans
Expandable duplicate groups
File preview for images
Smart selection (auto-select older duplicates)

File Management:

Safe deletion with confirmation
Size calculations and space savings
File metadata display (size, date modified)
Visual similarity percentages

📁 Project Structure:

pubspec.yaml - Dependencies and project configuration
lib/main.dart - App entry point with BLoC setup
lib/screens/home_screen.dart - Main scanning interface
lib/screens/results_screen.dart - Duplicate results display
lib/bloc/ - State management (BLoC pattern)
lib/models/duplicate_item.dart - Data models
lib/services/ - File operations and AI detection
lib/widgets/ - Reusable UI components
android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml - Android permissions

🛠 To Set Up:

Create a new Flutter project: flutter create duplicate_removal_ai
Replace the generated files with the provided code
Run flutter pub get to install dependencies
Build and test: flutter run

🔧 Key Technologies:

Flutter BLoC for state management
Crypto library for file hashing
Image package for visual similarity detection
File picker and Path provider for file access
Permission handler for storage access

The app uses advanced algorithms to detect both exact duplicates (via SHA-256 hashing) and visually similar images (via perceptual hashing), making it a powerful tool for cleaning up device storage!
